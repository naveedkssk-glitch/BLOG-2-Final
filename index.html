    <p>The Municipal Corporation Rawalpindi (MCR) has launched construction of a dedicated “walking street” from Fowara Chowk to Dingi Khoi in Raja Bazaar, modeled after the Saddar Cantonment pedestrian zone.</p>
    <p>According to Municipal Officer Infrastructure Rafaqat Gondal, the Rs. 250 million project has already started and is expected to be completed within six months. He said the scheme would help ease pedestrian movement, reduce congestion, and provide a modernized shopping environment in one of the busiest parts of the city.</p>

    <p>As part of the project, electricity, PTCL, and SNGPL service lines will be shifted underground to improve the bazaar’s outlook and ensure modern civic amenities. Officials said the walking street would provide a safer and more accessible space for families and shoppers, while addressing long-standing traffic hazards in the area.</p>
    <p>The initiative is part of MCR’s broader city beautification program, which includes infrastructure development and civic upgrades across Rawalpindi.</p>

    <p>Authorities noted that the Saddar walking street had already boosted commercial activity and shopping hours, and a similar impact is expected in Raja Bazaar. The project is aimed at transforming the market into a pedestrian-friendly hub and enhancing the overall shopping experience for citizens.</p>
